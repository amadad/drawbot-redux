# Typography Style Guide
*Based on Jost Hochuli's "Detail in Typography"*

## Foundation Principles

### Core Philosophy
Typography should prioritize **optimal text reception** over personal aesthetic preference. Formal elements serve legibility and readability, not individual taste. Detail typography focuses on micro-level components: letters, letterspacing, words, wordspacing, lines, linespacing, and columns.

### Scientific Basis
All typography decisions should be grounded in research about eye movement patterns, reading behavior, and objective legibility measures rather than subjective preferences.

## The Reading Process

### Saccade Mechanics
- **Fixed periods**: 0.2–0.4 seconds per fixation
- **Saccade span**: 5–10 letters (1–2 words in English)
- **Sharp focus**: Only 3–4 letters focused sharply during each fixation
- **Context perception**: Remaining 6–7 letters perceived indistinctly
- **Regression saccades**: Eyes jump back when text meaning is unclear

### Eye Movement Patterns
- Line beginnings and ends determine saccades at line changes
- German texts: Words with initial capitals fixed on more frequently
- Long words cause multiple fixations even for experienced readers
- Visual motor activity controlled by brain's language areas
- Word-images in visual memory read faster than unfamiliar ones

### Reading Speed Limitations
- Experienced readers have shorter fixed periods and bigger saccades
- Too-fast reading requires text guessing (language redundancy helps)
- Reading speed increases are limited even with intensive training
- Jan Tschichold's claim about reading speed was incorrect

### Objective Measurement
Eye movement registration objectively assesses text legibility:
- Line length variations affect reading speed
- Type size and shape impact saccade patterns
- Letter-background contrast influences fixation frequency
- Measured variables correlate with subjective legibility impressions

## Letter-Level Guidelines

### Historical Development
Letters evolved slowly, adapting to writing techniques, tools, materials, production methods, and styles. Changes occur mostly in details rather than basic structure, usually unnoticed over long periods.

### Dual Reception Process
Written typography is received in two ways:
1. **Reading process**: Brain conversion of perceived letter succession
2. **Visual perception**: Mostly unconscious associations and feelings

### Typeface Appropriateness
No typeface is universally good or bad. Different contexts require different solutions:
- **Continuous text**: Conservative, familiar forms
- **Headlines/advertising**: Can use attention-grabbing, experimental types
- **Book readers**: Prefer conservative typography, don't want to notice letters

### Timeless Type Characteristics
1. **Familiarity**: Reader's eye must not be distracted by unfamiliar forms
2. **Consistency**: All letters same style but clearly differentiated
3. **Proper proportions**: Capitals and lowercase in harmony
4. **Optical balance**: Capitals slightly lower than ascenders

### Optical Requirements for Letters

#### Basic Optical Facts
1. **Circle/triangle scaling**: For equal apparent height, circles and triangles must extend beyond baseline and capline
2. **Mathematical center illusion**: Upper half appears larger; optical center lies above mathematical center  
3. **Weight compensation**: Horizontals must be narrower than verticals for equal apparent weight
4. **Curve intersection lumps**: Require correction where curves meet straights or other curves
5. **Size-dependent proportions**: Small sizes need proportionally wider letters than large sizes

#### Letter Spacing Fundamentals
**Counter relationship**: Letterspacing is a function of letter interior spaces (counters)
- Small counters = small letterspacing
- Large counters = large letterspacing
- Applies to Roman, Blackletter, Italic, Greek, Cyrillic, and all written letters

#### Size-Dependent Spacing
- Larger type sizes need proportionally tighter letterspacing
- Smaller type sizes need proportionally wider letterspacing
- Letterspacing should match median lightness of letter counters

#### Special Cases
**Narrow typefaces**: Narrow sanserifs and italics may need additional letterspacing in small sizes
- Amount depends on specific typeface design and size
- Must be determined case-by-case

#### Lowercase Spacing Standards
For lowercase, there is theoretically one correct spacing for any given type size (variables within extremely narrow range).

#### Capital Spacing Standards
**Minimum space**: Determined by lightness of biggest counters (C, D, G, O, Q)
- If these letters cause "holes," spacing too tight
- Can be increased considerably with appropriate surroundings
- Widely spaced capitals need abundant surrounding space

## Word-Level Guidelines

### Word Recognition
Adult readers register whole words or word parts, not individual letters. Letters must be:
- Clearly differentiated from each other
- Capable of harmonious combination into words

### Lowercase vs. Capitals
**Lowercase advantages**:
- X-height, ascenders, descenders create characteristic word-forms
- Enhanced by accents, i-dots, t-height, individual letter contours

**Capital disadvantages**:
- Produce rectangular patterns without differentiation
- Particularly difficult to read
- Require large amounts of space

### Upper/Lower Differentiation Requirements
- Ascenders and descenders must be clearly differentiated
- Achieved through adequate length AND character design (especially serifs)
- Critical for word recognition

### Grey Tonality Principle
Consistent, even (but not boring) grey tonality essential across:
- Individual letters
- Individual words
- Individual lines
- Entire pages

Spotty, uneven appearance results from incorrect letterspacing (too great, too little, or uneven).

### Proportional Relationships
As letters become proportionally leaner with increased size, letterspaces also become proportionally smaller with increasing type size.

---

## Word Spacing Specifications

### Basic Formula
**General rule**: "As much as necessary, as little as possible"
**Standard measurement**: Approximately 1/4 of notional body size
- Example: 2.5 points for 10pt type
- Critical eye must make final decision

### Size-Dependent Scaling
- **Smaller sizes**: Require proportionally more space
- **Larger sizes**: Require proportionally less space
- **Counter relationship**: Like letterspacing, wordspacing function of letter counters

### Counter-Based Calculation
- Small counters = smaller wordspaces
- Large counters = larger wordspaces
- Broad types need larger wordspaces
- Narrow types need smaller wordspaces

### Quality Standards
- **Too loose**: Creates "holes" and disrupts line unity
- **Too tight**: Causes word collision and readability problems
- **Correct**: Even, well-balanced line appearance
- **When uncertain**: Too tight preferable to too loose

### Historical Reference
19th/early 20th century: Compositors often used en spaces (half body size) for speed, creating excessively loose wordspacing.

---

## Line-Level Specifications

### Optimal Line Length
**Primary recommendation**: 60-70 characters per line (as used in reference book)
**Acceptable range**: 50-60 characters (Tinker's alternative)
**Minimum functional**: 50 characters (below this, justified setting becomes difficult)

### Language Variations
- **German**: Requires longer lines than English, French, or Italian (longer words)
- **English**: 60-70 characters represents compromise between optimum character count and even spacing

### Line Length Effects
- **Too short**: Causes obvious wordspace unevenness and large "holes"
- **Too long**: Tiring and detracts from readability
- **Academic works**: May require longer lines for formulas, tables, diagrams

### Justified vs. Unjustified Setting

#### Justified Composition
**Process**: Space distributed between words to make equal line lengths
**Requirements**:
- Wide enough measure for even spacing
- Good hyphenation and justification programming
- Ability to reduce wordspaces to fit more content
- "Driving out" lines when necessary

**Quality Standards**:
- Good justified setting has even, neutral appearance
- No noticeable wordspace variations
- Requires 60-70 characters for English optimal performance

#### Unjustified (Ragged) Setting
**Advantages**:
- Even wordspacing within lines (more regular text appearance)
- Irregular right margin (more lively appearance)
- Solves narrow measure problems

**Two production methods**:
1. **Basic**: No word breaks, no special attention
2. **Refined**: Reasonable word breaks with appropriate hyphenation zone

### Typography Rules
- **Consecutive word-breaks**: Maximum 3 successive line-end breaks (but avoid large gaps)
- **Vertical rivers**: Adjust page makeup to prevent wordspaces aligning vertically
- **Paragraph indication**: Use indents, not line spaces (breaks up pages, wastes space)

## Linespacing & Column Design

### Fundamental Relationships
Linespacing interdependent with:
- Type size
- Line length  
- Typeface characteristics
- Overall readability

### Spacing Requirements by Context
- **Longer lines**: Need more linespacing for given typeface and size
- **Lighter typefaces**: (Large counters) need more linespacing than darker ones
- **Internal letter form**: Influences linespacing needs (like letter- and wordspacing)

### Typographic Color Control
Linespacing is important means for changing "colour" (grey tone) of composition.

### Technical Considerations
**Optical margin alignment**: 
- Less important for smaller type sizes
- Should be applied whenever technically possible
- Makes composition appear quieter even in small sizes

### Advanced Techniques
**Type size reduction**: Sometimes necessary to reduce type size while maintaining same linespacing
- Creates optically greater linespacing
- Makes line following easier
- Improves both attractiveness and readability

**Baseline grid maintenance**: Text inserts in smaller sizes must resume main baseline grid afterwards.

### Demonstration Examples
Same text in same typeface with different linespacing creates different impressions:
- 10pt Minion Regular with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6pt leading all appear different
- Overall impression affected by both linespacing and general text arrangement

## Numerals & Mathematical Typography

### Terminology
- **Number**: Quantitative concept
- **Numeral**: Graphic sign representing number  
- **Figures**: Typography term for numerals

### Numeral Types
1. **Lining figures**: Same height (usually matching capitals), constant en body for tabular use
2. **Non-lining figures**: Individual widths, varying heights
3. **Small cap figures**: Same height as small caps (rarely available)
4. **Superior/Inferior figures**: Superscripts and subscripts
5. **Fractions**: Specialized fraction numerals

### Usage Guidelines
- **With small caps**: Use small cap figures if available, otherwise non-lining figures
- **Large numbers**: Group in threes with commas (or spaces in scientific publications)
- **Superior figures**: Require small but unmistakable space from preceding letter
- **Inferior figures**: Should lie somewhat below baseline

### Technical Corrections
- Figure 1 often placed on too-wide body (requires manual correction)
- Superior/inferior figures may need size or position adjustment
- Default settings often inadequate for satisfactory results

### Spacing Requirements
**Colon spacing**: Between figures appears too close if unspaced, creates "holes" with normal wordspacing
- Requires consistent spacing matching overall typography
- Example: 1:2, 2:3, 3:4 ratios need careful spacing balance

## Emphasis Systems

### Primary Emphasis: Italic
**Advantages**:
- Attracts attention without disturbing text flow
- Classic, time-tested method
- Maintains reading rhythm

**Limitations**:
- Somewhat slower to read than roman
- Should be used sparingly
- Large quantities not appreciated by readers

### Secondary Emphasis: Small Caps
**Characteristics**:
- Optical height same as x-height of lowercase
- Cannot be substituted with smaller capitals (appear too pale)
- Same weight as uppercase/lowercase but broader proportions

**Spacing considerations**:
- Slight, even spacing generally improves readability
- Depends on specific typeface design
- Words beginning with capitals need full capital even in small cap text

### Other Emphasis Methods
**Disruptive forms** (produce restless effect, hinder linear reading):
- Text set in capitals
- Semi-bold or bold versions
- Underlining
- Larger type sizes
- Different typefaces
- Second colors or tones

**Appropriate contexts** for disruptive emphasis:
- Reference works
- Schoolbooks  
- Experimental books (refreshing effect)

### Small Caps vs. False Small Caps
**True small caps**: Proper weight matching text type, broader proportions
**False small caps**: Smaller-sized capitals, appear too pale and narrow

---

## Type Quality Assessment

### Legibility Research Findings
- All well-known, frequently used typefaces equally legible
- Semi-bold versions also equally legible
- Sanserifs equally legible but may be perceived as unattractive
- Optical legibility vs. attractiveness can differ significantly

### Atmospheric Communication
Beyond primary function as language transport, typefaces communicate atmosphere through appearance alone:
- Trigger particular feelings in readers
- Can have positive or negative impact regardless of legibility
- Effect may be ephemeral and culturally dependent

### Contextual Interpretation
**Appropriate typeface choice**:
- May interpret text in various ways (like musical performances)
- Must reflect spirit of work, not work against it
- Interaction of text and type includes size, arrangement, emphasis

### Comprehensive Assessment Requirements
Typeface impression can only be assessed when ALL compared typefaces use:
- Same text
- Same size
- Same measure
- Same linespacing
- Same printing method
- Same ink and inking
- Same paper
- Same margins

### Interdependence Effects
Any change to any element changes type impression—all elements interrelated. In books, elements also related to:
- Physical extent
- Binding stability/flexibility
- Binding materials
- Haptic nature and physicality

### Practical Implications
**Theoretical vs. practical**:
- Less attractive typeface can be enhanced through proper choice of other elements
- Skillful deployment of all elements can achieve "right note"
- Typeface analyses often purely theoretical, neglecting typographic complexity
- Prescribed solutions danger—creative typographers guard against this

## Multi-Language Considerations

### Language-Specific Text Images
Same typeface, size, line width, and linespacing create different appearances across languages due to unique text-image characteristics:
- English
- German  
- Dutch
- French
- Italian

Each language has distinctive visual rhythm and texture requiring consideration in typography design.

### Capital Letter Frequency
German texts particularly affected by frequent capitals:
- Words with initial capitals more frequently fixated
- Disrupts overall typeface appearance
- Capitals should be somewhat lower than lowercase ascenders

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Measurement Standards
- **10pt type wordspacing**: 2.5 points standard
- **Line length**: 60-70 characters optimal
- **Saccade span**: 5-10 letters per fixation
- **Fixation duration**: 0.2-0.4 seconds
- **Sharp focus range**: 3-4 letters per fixation

### Quality Control Checklist
1. **Grey tonality**: Consistent across letters, words, lines, pages
2. **Counter relationships**: Letterspacing matches counter spaces
3. **Size proportions**: Spacing scales appropriately with type size
4. **Language requirements**: Adequate line length for specific language
5. **Emphasis hierarchy**: Maintains reading flow while providing differentiation

### Technical Specifications
- **Optical margin alignment**: Apply when technically possible
- **Baseline grid**: Maintain consistency across text inserts
- **Hyphenation zones**: Set appropriate ranges for unjustified text
- **Kerning adjustments**: Manual correction for specific character pairs
- **Superior/inferior spacing**: Small but unmistakable separation
