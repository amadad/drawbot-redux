# Archived Documentation

This directory contains reference materials that have been extracted and refined into the active documentation.

## Archived Files

### type.md (110KB)
**Full transcription of Jost Hochuli's "Detail in Typography"**

- Original OCR/markdown of the complete book
- Comprehensive typography theory and principles
- **Extracted into**: `style.md` (microtypography) + `layout-design-principles.md` (composition)
- **Keep for**: Deep theoretical questions, historical context, research

### Hochuli-DetailnTypography.pdf (5.6MB)
**Original PDF of "Detail in Typography"**

- Source material for type.md
- High-quality reference with illustrations
- **Keep for**: Human reading, visual examples
- **Not used by**: AI agent (not machine-readable, too large)

## Why Archived?

These files are preserved for reference but aren't actively used by the drawbot-designer agent because:

1. **Efficiency**: The actionable knowledge has been extracted into focused guides
2. **Context**: Agent needs rules/formulas, not narrative explanations
3. **Size**: Combined 5.7MB → too much context for common tasks

## Active Documentation

The agent uses these instead:
- **layout-design-principles.md** - Macro-typography (composition, grids, hierarchy)
- **typography-style-guide.md** - Microtypography (spacing, readability, emphasis)
- **drawbot-api-quick-reference.md** - DrawBot API functions
- **drawbot-image-filters-reference.md** - ImageObject filters

## Accessing Archived Files

If you need deep typography theory or want to consult the original source:

```bash
# Read type.md
cat docs/archive/type.md

# Open PDF
open docs/archive/Hochuli-DetailnTypography.pdf
```

The knowledge is still available - just organized for better agent performance.
