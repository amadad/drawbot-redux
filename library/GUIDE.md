## 🎨 Path 2: Designer Learning to Code
*"I know design principles but need to translate them to code"*

### Week 1: Design Systems in Code
1. **Translating your knowledge**
   - `foundations/` - All files (you know these concepts!)
   - Focus on how design principles become variables
   - Exercise: Recreate a grid system you use

2. **Historical inspiration**
   - `historical_studies/bauhaus_layout.py`
   - `historical_studies/swiss_style_poster.py`
   - Project: Code a poster in a historical style

### Week 2-3: Generative Design
1. **Beyond static layouts**
   - `cookbook/pattern_generation.py` - Algorithmic patterns
   - `tutorials/intermediate/` - Parametric design
   - Exercise: Create 100 unique variations of a logo

2. **Data-driven design**
   - `cookbook/data_visualization.py` - Visualizing information
   - Project: Design an infographic from data

### Week 4: Advanced Applications
- `projects/logo_system.py` - Flexible identity systems
- `projects/book_cover_designer.py` - Automated layouts
- Final: Create a generative brand identity

## 💻 Path 3: Programmer Exploring Design
*"I can code but want to understand visual design"*

### Week 1: Design Fundamentals
1. **Core principles**
   - `foundations/composition_rules.py` - Visual hierarchy
   - `foundations/color_theory.py` - Color relationships
   - Read: Comments about design history in each file

2. **Typography as a system**
   - `foundations/typography_systems.py` - Type scales
   - Exercise: Implement a modular scale function

### Week 2: Learning from History
1. **Computational interpretations**
   - All files in `historical_studies/`
   - Notice how design movements become algorithms
   - Project: Parametrize a design style

### Week 3-4: Advanced Techniques
1. **Complex systems**
   - `tutorials/advanced/` - Recursive designs
   - `interactive/parameter_exploration.py` - UI controls
   - Build: A tool for non-programmers to create designs

## 💡 Tips for Success

### General Advice
1. **Run everything** - Even if you don't understand it yet
2. **Modify values** - Change numbers and see what happens
3. **Break things** - Errors teach you how things work
4. **Combine examples** - Mix techniques from different files

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Don't skip the basics - They're foundational
2. Don't just copy - Understand and modify
3. Don't ignore comments - They contain wisdom
4. Don't work in isolation - Share your work
