## 📖 Learning Paths

### For Complete Beginners
1. Start with `basics/` - Learn fundamental concepts
2. Move to `tutorials/beginner/` - Build your first projects
3. Try `workbook/exercises_basic.py` - Practice what you learned
4. Explore `cookbook/` - See practical applications

### For Designers with Some Coding Experience
1. Review `foundations/` - Understand design systems in code
2. Jump to `tutorials/intermediate/` - Advanced techniques
3. Study `historical_studies/` - Learn from the masters
4. Create something in `projects/` - Apply your knowledge

### For Experienced Programmers New to Design
1. Start with `foundations/` - Learn design principles
2. Explore `historical_studies/` - Understand design context
